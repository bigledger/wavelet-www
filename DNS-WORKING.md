## 🔍 Why Some Browsers Might Still Show Issues

### DNS Caching

The old DNS record (104.154.43.123) might be cached in:

1. **Your Computer's DNS Cache**
   - Windows: `ipconfig /flushdns`
   - Mac: `sudo dscacheutil -flushcache; sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder`
   - Linux: `sudo systemd-resolve --flush-caches`

2. **Your Browser's Cache**
   - Clear browser cache and cookies
   - Or use Incognito/Private mode

3. **Your Router's Cache**
   - Restart router OR wait 5-30 minutes

4. **ISP's DNS Cache**
   - Wait 30-60 minutes for propagation

### Current DNS Records

```bash
# Some DNS servers still return old IP
dig bigledger.com +short
→ 104.154.43.123 (Old - cached)

# But actual connection goes to:
curl -v http://bigledger.com 2>&1 | grep "Trying"
→ Trying 15.197.225.128 (New - GoDaddy Forwarding) ✅
```

This is normal during DNS propagation period (0-48 hours, usually < 1 hour).

## ✅ What's Working RIGHT NOW

### From Command Line (No Cache)
```bash
✅ curl http://bigledger.com   → Redirects to https://www.bigledger.com (200 OK)
✅ curl https://bigledger.com  → Redirects to https://www.bigledger.com (200 OK)
✅ curl http://www.bigledger.com  → Redirects to https://www.bigledger.com (200 OK)
✅ curl https://www.bigledger.com → Direct access (200 OK)
```

### From Browser (May vary by cache)
- **Incognito/Private Mode**: Should work ✅
- **Normal Mode**: May need cache clear ⚠️
- **After 30-60 minutes**: Will work for everyone ✅

## 🎯 For Users Experiencing Issues

**Immediate Fix:**
1. Open browser in **Incognito/Private mode**
