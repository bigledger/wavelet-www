## Issues Found & Fixed

### Fixed Issues:

1. **Developers Page - Documentation UI Elements (FIXED 04:16 UTC)**
   - **Issue**: Developers page was displaying documentation sidebar with ">" arrows and table of contents
   - **Root Cause**: Front matter in `/content/en/developers/_index.md` contained `type: docs` and `bookCollapseSection: true` which overrode global settings
   - **Fix**: Removed problematic front matter, keeping only title and description
   - **Result**: Page now displays with clean corporate header and footer, no sidebar or TOC
   - **Deployed**: October 1, 2025, 04:16 UTC

**All issues resolved - site fully operational with clean corporate appearance**
