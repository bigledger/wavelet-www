**Don't:**
- ❌ "Click Here" (vague)
- ❌ "Submit" (transactional)
- ❌ "Learn More" overused (too generic)
- ❌ "Buy Now" (too aggressive for B2B)

**A/B Testing Recommendations:**
- Test button colors (blue vs. green)
- Test copy variations ("Try Free" vs. "Start Trial")
- Test button size (large vs. medium)
