&lt;h2>Knock Off Config:﻿&lt;span class="hx:absolute hx:-mt-20" id="knock-off-config">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#knock-off-config" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>&lt;h3>What is KO (Knock Off)?&lt;span class="hx:absolute hx:-mt-20" id="what-is-ko-knock-off">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#what-is-ko-knock-off" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>A Knock Off (KO) configuration is used when a company needs to manage document issuance tracking for transactions involving:
✅ Customer invoices (e.g., tracking whether an invoice has been fully paid).
✅ Supplier invoices (e.g., ensuring payments are properly recorded against supplier bills).
Essentially, KO helps automate reconciliation between issued invoices and received payments, preventing discrepancies in financial records.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3>When Should You Configure a KO?&lt;span class="hx:absolute hx:-mt-20" id="when-should-you-configure-a-ko">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#when-should-you-configure-a-ko" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Configuring a KO is optional but may be necessary if:
The company wants to track payments against invoices in an automated manner.
The business requires document issuance verification before transactions are marked as completed.
There is a need to link invoice issuance to supplier/customer transactions for internal processing.
A critical setup for the company to configure the workflow. Click on the &amp;lsquo;+&amp;rsquo; button to begin setup.
Server Doc Type Options: Essential for setting up the company&amp;rsquo;s workflow, such as configuring the process for purchase orders, converting them into purchase GRNs or invoices, or setting up the sales process (from sales orders to sales invoices). The configuration is based on document types.
The user needs to select the server type. Server Type 1 refers to the source document, while Server Type 2 refers to the target document
This is an example of a basic knock-off (KO) setup flow for the customer. For instance, when the user creates an invoice, there will be two knock-off options: Sales Order and Sales Quotation.
This means that in the Sales Invoice applet, under the KO (knock-off) tab, the user will see two options: Sales Order and Sales Quotation.
Users can enable or disable knock-off settings from the main tab page.
The KO (knock-off) options depend on the customer configuration and the user&amp;rsquo;s needs. The user can add more options if needed by configuring them in the Organisation applet when creating or editing the company details.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2>Advance Filter Search﻿&lt;span class="hx:absolute hx:-mt-20" id="advance-filter-search">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#advance-filter-search" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>&lt;p>The advanced filter allows you to search by company, company name, registration number, or status. Each sub-module includes this advanced filtering option.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
