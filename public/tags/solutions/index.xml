&lt;h2>Success Story 3 : Automotive and Workshop Industry﻿&lt;span class="hx:absolute hx:-mt-20" id="success-story-3--automotive-and-workshop-industry">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#success-story-3--automotive-and-workshop-industry" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Wavelet is an entrusted solution provider to one of the most well-known European market players in the automotive industry (with currently served headquarters in Singapore and Malaysia). One of the key challenges faced by the client was the lack of customer engagement and personalized &amp;rsquo;touch&amp;rsquo; when executing their marketing activities. No software had been set in place to stay connected with customers and provide convenience for their financing needs.
The scope of the project has involved a CRM Application which consists of both Mobile Application and Admin Console. The Mobile application is running on Android and iOS which addresses the needs of multiple car brands. The Admin Console back-office system is a complete package that administers marketing events, promotions, member card privileges and custom messages. It also incorporates other versatile features such as invoice management, audit trail reports, target group management, updating of terms and conditions, and landing pages.
In addition to optimising the data exchange between the automotive business and end customers via an implemented CRM app, Wavelet has integrated the software to the current back-end ERP system for the automation of the financial module and invoice management. The system allows the car owner to pay their car loan directly via the app, with the data being pushed directly to the back-end system for further processing.
Furthermore, Wavelet serves several largest car servicing and workshop market players in Malaysia. One of the long-served clients is a renowned car servicing centre, established in the 1980s, with a wide network across the country. Servicing more than 15,000 vehicles monthly, the customer owns 20 branches in the Klang Valley and beyond.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3>The key challenges that the customer had faced with their previous system were:﻿&lt;span class="hx:absolute hx:-mt-20" id="the-key-challenges-that-the-customer-had-faced-with-their-previous-system-were">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#the-key-challenges-that-the-customer-had-faced-with-their-previous-system-were" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Slow deployment for new outlets.
No support from the software vendor.
Manual data submission.
No standardization and duplication of item codes.
With the newly implemented systems, the management obtained increased capacity to control activities and have a comprehensive view of their business with instant access to critical data, anytime, anywhere while also gaining total control over multiple companies and branches in one single console. Additionally, the software has provided effective support to optimise cash flow and inventory, reduce handling costs and improve speed, eliminating duplicate data entries and minimising human error.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Food and Beverage (F&amp;B) Industry</title><link>https://wiki.bigledger.com/industry-solutions/food-and-beverage-fb-industry/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://wiki.bigledger.com/industry-solutions/food-and-beverage-fb-industry/</guid><description>

&lt;a href="#success-story-2--food-and-beverage-fb-industry" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>&lt;p>With years of extensive experience in the Malaysia market, Wavelet team has been serving one of the largest Southeast Asia&amp;rsquo;s F&amp;amp;B brands with over hundred outlets across the country. With the strong ability to cater to the needs of multi-branch, multi-franchise businesses facing the high volume of daily transactions, Wavelet ERP system has been serving its growing business as a backend for the inventory and accounting data management of its direct branches and franchise businesses for many years.
The consolidated reporting from multiple separate entities is one of the key values provided by Wavelet, allowing the management to make informed business-wide strategic decisions with ease and convenience. The ERP has been integrated to the Point-of-Sale (POS) system for real-time data syncing between both software systems.
In addition, the Wavelet team has assisted to provide end-to-end consolidated solutions for the client&amp;rsquo;s bank reconciliation, allowing to automatically clear matching transactions and identify mismatches. The project implementation has covered more than just a simple automation of bank reconciliation activities, and has included the direct integration with one of the largest Malaysia banks. With the seamless integration across provided solutions, the entire process cycle has been automated, benefiting the client with the saved time and energy for the resource-consuming activities.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Industry Guide</title><link>https://wiki.bigledger.com/industry-solutions/industry-guide/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://wiki.bigledger.com/industry-solutions/industry-guide/</guid><description>

With over 150 customers impacted by pandemic, Wavelet team has demonstrated its ability to guide and implement scalable cloud solutions at the fast pace - a &amp;ldquo;life savior&amp;rdquo; for businesses in the pandemic era.
Founded in 2003, Wavelet Solutions has been known as one of the most mature web-based ERP software providers in Malaysia, taking care of the consolidated accounting and inventory management for small and medium enterprises. However, the team has not stopped there. With the vision to become one of the major players in the market for cloud-native applications, the Akaun data lake platform was born.

Wavelet&amp;rsquo;s approach is different from other software providers. Driven by the vision of revolutionizing the way businesses would consume software services, the team is aimed to become an entrusted technology partner and consultant (rather than a vendor) to the local and overseas businesses. The digital transformation powered by their solutions takes into account business needs, workflow, future growth and goals, and most importantly - Who Your Business Vision is.
Serving customers of various sizes, including SMEs and large enterprises, from 20 different industries across 5 countries, Wavelet team provides much needed IT backbone and infrastructure to support their growing business.&lt;/p>
