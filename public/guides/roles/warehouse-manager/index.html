    <a href="#role-profile" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h2><p><strong>Position:</strong> Warehouse Manager<br>
<strong>Industry Focus:</strong> Distribution centers and retail warehouses in Malaysia<br>
<strong>System:</strong> BigLedger Inventory Management System</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong> Experienced warehouse operations manager overseeing receiving, storage, picking, packing, and shipping operations. Responsible for inventory accuracy, team supervision, supplier coordination, and operational efficiency while maintaining safety and compliance standards.</p>

<h2>1. Inventory Receiving and Putaway Operations<span class="hx:absolute hx:-mt-20" id="1-inventory-receiving-and-putaway-operations"></span>
    <a href="#1-inventory-receiving-and-putaway-operations" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h2><h3>Scenario-Based Questions:<span class="hx:absolute hx:-mt-20" id="scenario-based-questions"></span>
    <a href="#scenario-based-questions" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h3><p><strong>Q1.1:</strong> &ldquo;We received a large shipment from our supplier in China, but the quantity delivered is 500 units short of what&rsquo;s on the purchase order. The driver is waiting for confirmation, and I have a receiving team ready to process. How do I efficiently handle this discrepancy in BigLedger while keeping the receiving dock moving? What documentation do I need for the insurance claim?&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Q1.2:</strong> &ldquo;During our morning receiving inspection, we found 200 units of electronic components with water damage - looks like the container had a leak during the monsoon season shipping. These items are time-sensitive for our production line. How do I properly document this in BigLedger, quarantine the damaged goods, and initiate a supplier claim while ensuring we don&rsquo;t disrupt our production schedule?&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Q1.3:</strong> &ldquo;I&rsquo;m expecting 5 different shipments today, but our receiving dock can only handle 2 trucks at a time due to space constraints. One shipment contains temperature-sensitive pharmaceuticals that need immediate processing, another has promotional items needed for tomorrow&rsquo;s retail delivery. How do I prioritize receiving and coordinate with suppliers for optimal dock scheduling?&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Q1.4:</strong> &ldquo;Our main supplier just delivered only 60% of our order due to their production delays, but I need to maintain minimum stock levels for our retail stores. How do I process this partial delivery in BigLedger, manage the backorder, and coordinate emergency stock from alternate suppliers without creating inventory confusion?&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Q2.2:</strong> &ldquo;We&rsquo;re entering durian season and need to reorganize our cold storage areas for increased fruit inventory while maintaining space for year-round frozen products.

<p><strong>Q2.3:</strong> &ldquo;Our high-value electronics section is getting crowded, and I need to move some items to overflow storage in our secondary warehouse building. How do I track these movements in BigLedger while maintaining security protocols and ensuring our cycle counting team knows the new locations?&rdquo;</p>
