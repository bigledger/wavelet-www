Every tenant in the Akaun Platform requires different applets for their own operations. Thus, every tenant in the Akaun Platform will be given access to his own unique catalog of applets which are designed for his own use.\nNext, the Applet Store consists of both public and private catalogs. The details of these catalogs are described below.","42-public-catalog#4.2 Public Catalog﻿":"Figure 6: Public Catalog Page\nWhen the users enter the Applet Store after accepting the terms of use of applets, they will be directed to the Public page that shows all the public catalogs with their associated applets. Public catalogs are catalogs that can be accessed by all parties. These catalogs store applets that are commonly used by all parties to perform their operations.\nFor instance, the screenshot above shows that the MLM Admin applet is an applet under the Public Catalog.\nFigure 7: Applet Information Display\nAdditionally, every individual applet in the Applet Store has its own specific icon, name and average user ratings.\nNext, every individual applet has its tenant code. For example, staging_tenant. The tenant code identifies the tenant to which the applet belongs. This is because some applets are required by many different tenants. For instance, the Cashbook Applet is needed by many tenants to manage their cash book and settlement methods. However, every tenant needs their version of the Cashbook Applet because they would like to store their private data in the applet. Thus, we have Cashbook Applets with different tenant codes in which each tenant code identifies a specific tenant user. Every tenant user can only access the applet which is associated with his tenant code.\nApart from that, every individual applet has its rank. The rank type includes OWNER, ADMIN and MEMBER. This is because users with different ranks have different roles in managing and using the applets. For instance, users with the ADMIN and OWNER rank have the read and write access in assigning permissions to other users in using an applet whereas the users with MEMBER rank can only have read access to the permissions in an applet.","43-private-catalog#4.3 Private Catalog﻿":"Figure 8: Private Catalog Page - Install All\nNext, when users click on the “Private” tab, they will be directed to the page that shows all the private catalogs as shown in the screenshot above. Private Catalogs are catalogs that can only be accessed by users who are given specific permission by the admin.\nThe admin of the Platform Sysadmin Applet can use this applet to assign permission for users to access their catalog of applets in the Applet Store. As mentioned previously, different clients will gain access to their own catalogs in order to use the relevant applets to carry out their particular operations. Thus, the catalogs and applets shown in this page vary by users.\nApart from that, a search bar is implemented on every catalog page for users to filter and search their desired applets easily. Users can search for their desired applets by typing the name of the applets in the search bar. The search function will be executed automatically once the users start typing words on the bar.\nNext, users can click on the “Install All” green button to install all the applets in the “Private” tab page at once. This can save their time from installing the applets individually.","44-my-applets#4.4 My Applets﻿":"Figure 9: My Applets Tab - Installed Applications\nNext, when users click on the “My Applets” tab, they will be directed to a page that shows all the applets they have installed.","50-installing-applets#5.0 Installing Applets﻿":"","51-applet-installation-page#5.1 Applet Installation Page﻿":"Figure 10: Applet Installation Page - Overview\nWhen users click on an applet icon in the catalog page, users will be able to read the details of the applet as shown in the screenshot above. The basic information of the applet that are displayed in this page includes:\nName of the applet Icon of the applet Platform location where the applet is stored Rank of the users in using the applet Tenant Code of the applet Compatibility of the applet to the users’ device Average ratings of the applet Number of users who rate the applet In order to install the particular applet, users can click on the green “Install” button in the applet page to perform the installation.\nFigure 11: Applet Installation Page - Applet Descriptions\nApart from that, users can view the images and videos that illustrate the features and functionalities of the applet. They can also read the description of the applet from the applet page. By doing that, the users can understand the functions of the applet and the mechanism of using the applet.\nAdditionally, they are able to know the type of the applet and the ranking of the applet in the Applet Store. For instance, the Stock Transfer applet shown in the screenshot above is labeled as the Business type applet. It is also ranked as the second top grossing applet, meaning the second top applet that generates the highest profit among all the available applets.\nFigure 12: Applet Installation Page - Ratings and Reviews\nMoreover, users are able to see the rating and reviews of each applet in the installation page of the respective applet. Firstly, the platform will calculate and generate the average user ratings of the applet besides showing the statistics of rating in the form of a horizontal bar chart. It also shows the total number of users who have given the rating.\nNext, users can also read the reviews of other users who comment on the applet. Additionally, users can also write their reviews under the reviews section and update their own reviews from time to time.\nThe applet installation page is still under development.","52-open-or-uninstall-applets#5.2 Open or Uninstall Applets﻿":"Figure 13: Applet Installation Page - Open or Uninstall the Applet\nAfter that, users can open the applet by clicking on the green “Open” button.\nOn the other hand, users can choose to uninstall the applet by clicking on the “Uninstall” button in the applet page.","53-access-installed-applets#5.3 Access Installed Applets﻿":"Figure 14: My Applets Page - Installed Applets\nAs mentioned previously, users can check their installed applets in the “My Applets” page in the Applet Store as shown in the screenshot above. This helps users to find and manage their installed applets easily. Additionally, applets that are successfully installed by the users will show a small green tick label at the bottom right of its layout as shown in the screenshot above.\nFigure 15: Akaun Platform - Installed Applets\nApart from that, users can directly access their installed applets when they log in to the http://akaun.com website as shown in the screenshot above. This helps the users to conveniently access their installed applets without entering the Applet Store.","60-applet-permission-settings#6.0 Applet Permission Settings﻿":"Generally, all applets in the Applet Store share some common features. One of the essential features is the permission setting for an applet. This is because a client who uses the applets may want to set specific permissions to regulate the access control of his employees in using the applets.\nFigure 16: Settings Tab\nFirstly, users can navigate to the “Settings” tab which is located at the bottom left of every opened applet as shown in the screenshot above to configure their applet settings.","61-permission-set#6.1 Permission Set﻿":"A permission template is a template that consists of one or multiple permission lines. Every permission line refers to a specific defined permission. For example, permission to create internal sales order invoices.\nA permission set is a permission template in which the permission lines are configured to targets. The target can be a branch, company, or location, depending on the permission template. By doing that, the targets are permitted to perform certain operations.\nOnly users with the ADMIN or OWNER rank in the applet can have read and write access in assigning the permissions to the applet users. Users with MEMBER rank have only read access to the permissions settings in the applet.\nFigure 17: Permission Set Page","611-create-permission-set#6.1.1 Create Permission Set﻿":"Figure 18: Permission Set - Create a Permission Set\nUsers click on the “+” button to start creating the permission set. After clicking on the button, the Add Permission Set page will appear from the right. Users then fill in the information of the permission set. The information to be filled includes:\nPerm Set Name*: The name of the permission set. Perm Set Code*: The code of the permission set. The code value should be unique and is immutable once it is saved. Perm Template*: The permission template. A permission template consists of many defined permission lines. Status*: Users should select the status “ACTIVE” to use the permission set. The * symbol indicates information that is compulsory to be filled.\nNext, the users have to click on the “Configure Permission Targets” box in order to start linking the permission lines in the selected permission template to the available targets.\nFigure 19: Permission Set - Configure Permission Set Lines\nA permission template consists of many permission lines. Thus, in the Configure Permission Set Lines page, users can select the permission set lines and assign each of them to a target. The users can proceed by clicking on the permission set line record they want to configure.\nFigure 20: Permission Set - Edit Permission Set Line\nThen, users will be directed to the Edit Permission Set Line page as shown above.\nUnder this page, the Permission Code, Permission Targets and Default Target information of the selected permission line are already filled and cannot be modified. The value of the Default Target information varies between Company, Location and Branch, depending on the permission template that is selected.\nUsers can provide some description for the permission set line. Then, users have to click on the “Select Target” box in order to assign the permission set line to a target.\nFigure 21: Permission Set - Add Target\nThen, users are directed to the Add Target page. In this example, the default target is the company. Thus, the Add Target page shows the information of the available companies. The information includes the Company Code and Company Name. Users can tick only one of the available companies and click the “SAVE” button to link it to the permission set line.\nFigure 22: Permission Set - Save Edited Permission Set Line\nThen, the users will be directed back to the previous page, which is the Edit Permission Set Line page. The target is selected successfully. They can continue to click the “SAVE” button to save the changes.\nFigure 23: Permission Set - Save the Configured Permission Set\nThen, the users will be directed back to the previous page, which is the Configure Permission Set Lines page. Users can repeat the process for the other permission set lines to assign the target to the permission lines respectively.\nWhen all the permissions targets are configured as desired, users can click on the “SAVE” button in the Add Permission Set page to save the changes.\nFigure 24: Permission Set - Successfully Created\nThe permission set that is successfully created will appear in the Permission Set page as shown in the screenshot above.\nIn order to assign the same permission set to multiple targets, the users have to create multiple permission sets. Every permissions set consists of the same permission lines but different naming. Then, users assign each permission set to the respective target.\nFor example:\nPermission_Set_Target_A to Target A. Permission_Set_Target_B to Target B.","612-edit-and-delete-permission-set#6.1.2 Edit and Delete Permission Set﻿":"If the users want to edit or delete a created permission set, users have to click on that permission set record in the Permission Set page.

CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) Separate read and write models for optimal performance:\n// Write Model (Commands) interface CreateInvoiceCommand { tenantId: string; customerId: string; items: InvoiceItemData[]; dueDate: Date; notes?: string; } // Read Model (Queries) interface InvoiceListQuery { tenantId: string; customerId?: string; status?: InvoiceStatus[]; dateRange?: DateRange; pagination: PaginationOptions; sorting: SortOptions; } interface InvoiceProjection { id: string; invoiceNumber: string; customerName: string; total: Money; status: InvoiceStatus; dueDate: Date; overdueDays?: number; } Multi-Tenancy Architecture Tenant Isolation Strategy BigLedger uses Schema-per-Tenant isolation for maximum security and performance:\n-- Database Structure bigledger_platform/ ├── shared/ │ ├── tenants │ ├── users │ ├── subscriptions │ └── system_config └── tenant_schemas/ ├── tenant_001/ │ ├── companies │ ├── accounts │ ├── transactions │ └── ... └── tenant_002/ ├── companies ├── accounts ├── transactions └── ...

Is there a way to bulk upload with platform-specific formatting?”\n“Our supplier just sent us updated product specifications for 200 items. I need to update these across all channels, but manually doing this will take days. Can EcomSync handle bulk updates across multiple platforms simultaneously?”","bulk-order-processing#Bulk Order Processing":"“B2B orders often require custom quotes and approval workflows.

Can we extend loyalty benefits to marketplace purchases?”","customer-segmentation#Customer Segmentation":"“We have different customer types - price-sensitive students who prefer Shopee, working professionals who buy from our website, and bulk buyers who use our B2B portal.

Do I need to maintain separate product catalogs, or can the system automatically format content for each marketplace’s requirements?”\n“We want to participate in Lazada’s 11.11 campaign with special bundle offers, but we don’t want these same bundles available on Shopee at the same time. How do I create platform-specific promotions without affecting other channels?”","omnichannel-support#Omnichannel Support":"“Customers contact us through multiple channels - Shopee chat, Lazada messages, website live chat, WhatsApp, and phone calls. Our support team struggles to maintain conversation history across these platforms. How can we provide consistent support?”\n“A customer bought on Shopee but has questions about product usage.

How do I optimize payment options for each channel?”","peak-season-management#Peak Season Management":"“During 12.12 last year, we received 500+ orders in one hour. Our team couldn’t keep up with order processing, and some orders shipped late.

They need to see their contract prices and available credit limits when browsing our B2B portal. How can we provide this personalized experience?”","product-variants-management#Product Variants Management":"“We sell clothing with multiple sizes and colors. Shopee shows variants differently than Lazada - Shopee uses a grid view while Lazada uses dropdown menus. How do I set up product variants that display correctly on each platform while maintaining synchronized inventory?”\n“Some of our products have 10+ variants (different sizes, colors, materials). Managing inventory for each variant across 4 channels is becoming a nightmare. What’s the best way to organize this in the system?”","real-time-updates#Real-Time Updates":"“Yesterday, a customer bought our last gaming chair in our Subang store at 2 PM. At 2:05 PM, someone ordered the same chair on Lazada. The Lazada order went through, but we had to cancel it later.

How do I reconcile inventory across all channels without temporarily closing all online stores?”","returns-and-exchanges#Returns and Exchanges":"“Marketplace returns are handled differently - Shopee allows direct returns, Lazada requires seller approval, and our website uses a third-party return service. How do I manage these different return processes efficiently?”\n“A customer bought an item on Shopee but wants to exchange it at our physical store. Our store staff don’t know how to process marketplace returns. What’s the proper workflow for cross-channel returns?”","review-and-feedback-management#Review and Feedback Management":"“Managing reviews across platforms is time-consuming. Shopee reviews need quick responses, Lazada allows detailed seller replies, and our website reviews affect SEO. How can I streamline review management and response?”","roi-tracking#ROI Tracking":"“We spend RM10,000 monthly on Facebook ads, RM5,000 on Google ads, and RM3,000 on marketplace promotions. I need to track which campaigns drive the most profitable sales, not just the most traffic.

How can we test content variations safely?”","shipping-and-logistics#Shipping and Logistics":"“We use different courier services for different channels - J\u0026T for Shopee, CityLink for Lazada, and our own delivery for website orders. Can the system automatically assign the right courier based on the sales channel and customer location?”\n“Sometimes our packaging team picks the wrong items or quantities.

We want to allocate 20 for Shopee, 15 for Lazada, 10 for our website, and 5 for walk-in customers.

The system allows the car owner to pay their car loan directly via the app, with the data being pushed directly to the back-end system for further processing. Furthermore, Wavelet serves several largest car servicing and workshop market players in Malaysia.

Pro Tips for Beginners:\nStart with just name and email - you can add details later Use consistent naming (always “Company Name” or “Last, First”) Add notes about how you met them or their preferences Set payment terms from day one to avoid confusion Common Beginner Questions:\n“What if I don’t know their payment terms?” → Start with your standard terms (like 30 days), you can change it later “Should I add every single person I might sell to?” → Only add real prospects or existing customers to keep your list clean “What if they’re both a customer and a supplier?” → Create separate customer and vendor records - BigLedger will link them if needed Real Example: Tom runs a landscaping business. His first customer entry looked like:\nName: “Johnson Residence” Contact: “Mary Johnson” Email: mary@email.com Terms: “Due on completion” Notes: “Referred by neighbor, prefers text messages” Q: What’s the difference between a quote and an invoice?\nA: Think of it like the difference between a restaurant menu (quote) and your bill (invoice):\nQuote (Estimate/Proposal):\nPurpose: “Here’s what it would cost IF you buy this” When to use: Before the customer commits Status: Proposed, not final Payment: No money expected yet Example: “Your website redesign would cost $3,000” Invoice (Bill):\nPurpose: “You bought this, please pay me” When to use: After work is done or product delivered Status: Final, legally binding Payment: Money is due Example: “Website redesign completed, payment of $3,000 due” The Natural Flow:\nCustomer inquires → Create a quote Customer approves → Convert quote to sales order Work completed/shipped → Convert to invoice Customer pays → Record payment Beginner-Friendly Process:\nStart with quotes for anything over $100 Always get approval before starting work Convert approved quotes to invoices (BigLedger does this automatically) Track which quotes turn into sales to improve your success rate Q: I keep hearing about “sales orders” - what are those and do I need them?\nA: Sales orders are like a contract between quote and invoice. Here’s when you need them:\nYou DON’T need sales orders if:\nYou provide services immediately (like haircuts) You sell simple products on the spot Payment happens immediately You DO need sales orders if:\nYou manufacture or custom-build products You order special items for customers Work takes weeks or months to complete You need to track what’s promised vs. what’s delivered Simple workflow WITH sales orders: Quote → Customer Approves → Sales Order → Work/Delivery → Invoice → Payment\nSimple workflow WITHOUT sales orders: Quote → Customer Approves → Work/Delivery → Invoice → Payment\nBottom line: Start without sales orders. Add them later if you find you need better tracking of work in progress.","error-prevention-and-recovery#Error Prevention and Recovery":"Q: What if I make a mistake?\nA: Mistakes happen to everyone! BigLedger is designed to help you fix them easily:\nCommon Mistakes and How to Fix Them:\n1. Wrong Amount on Invoice\nEasy fix: Edit the invoice if not paid yet If already paid: Create a credit note for difference 2.
