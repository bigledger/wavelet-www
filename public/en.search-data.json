Every tenant in the Akaun Platform requires different applets for their own operations. Thus, every tenant in the Akaun Platform will be given access to his own unique catalog of applets which are designed for his own use. Next, the Applet Store consists of both public and private catalogs. The details of these catalogs are described below.","42-public-catalog#4.2 Public Catalog﻿":"Public Catalog Page When the users enter the Applet Store after accepting the terms of use of applets, they will be directed to the Public page that shows all the public catalogs with their associated applets. Public catalogs are catalogs that can be accessed by all parties. These catalogs store applets that are commonly used by all parties to perform their operations. For instance, the screenshot above shows that the MLM Admin applet is an applet under the Public Catalog. Figure 2. Applet Information Additionally, every individual applet in the Applet Store has its own specific icon, name and average user ratings. Next, every individual applet has its tenant code. For example, staging_tenant. The tenant code identifies the tenant to which the applet belongs. This is because some applets are required by many different tenants. For instance, the Cashbook Applet is needed by many tenants to manage their cash book and settlement methods. However, every tenant needs their version of the Cashbook Applet because they would like to store their private data in the applet. Thus, we have Cashbook Applets with different tenant codes in which each tenant code identifies a specific tenant user. Every tenant user can only access the applet which is associated with his tenant code. Apart from that, every individual applet has its rank. The rank type includes OWNER, ADMIN and MEMBER. This is because users with different ranks have different roles in managing and using the applets. For instance, users with the ADMIN and OWNER rank have the read and write access in assigning permissions to other users in using an applet whereas the users with MEMBER rank can only have read access to the permissions in an applet.","43-private-catalog#4.3 Private Catalog﻿":"Private Catalog Page - Install All Next, when users click on the “Private” tab, they will be directed to the page that shows all the private catalogs as shown in the screenshot above. Private Catalogs are catalogs that can only be accessed by users who are given specific permission by the admin. The admin of the Platform Sysadmin Applet can use this applet to assign permission for users to access their catalog of applets in the Applet Store. As mentioned previously, different clients will gain access to their own catalogs in order to use the relevant applets to carry out their particular operations. Thus, the catalogs and applets shown in this page vary by users. Apart from that, a search bar is implemented on every catalog page for users to filter and search their desired applets easily. Users can search for their desired applets by typing the name of the applets in the search bar. The search function will be executed automatically once the users start typing words on the bar. Next, users can click on the “Install All” green button to install all the applets in the “Private” tab page at once. This can save their time from installing the applets individually.","44-my-applets#4.4 My Applets﻿":"Next, when users click on the “My Applets” tab, they will be directed to a page that shows all the applets they have installed.","50-installing-applets#5.0 Installing Applets﻿":"","51-applet-installation-page#5.1 Applet Installation Page﻿":"Applet Installation Page When users click on an applet icon in the catalog page, users will be able to read the details of the applet as shown in the screenshot above. The basic information of the applet that are displayed in this page includes: Name of the applet Icon of the applet Platform location where the applet is stored Rank of the users in using the applet Tenant Code of the applet Compatibility of the applet to the users’ device Average ratings of the appletIcon of the applet Number of users who rate the applet In order to install the particular applet, users can click on the green “Install” button in the applet page to perform the installation. Figure 2. Applet Installation Page - Applet Descriptions Apart from that, users can view the images and videos that illustrate the features and functionalities of the applet. They can also read the description of the applet from the applet page. By doing that, the users can understand the functions of the applet and the mechanism of using the applet. Additionally, they are able to know the type of the applet and the ranking of the applet in the Applet Store. For instance, the Stock Transfer applet shown in the screenshot above is labeled as the Business type applet. It is also ranked as the second top grossing applet, meaning the second top applet that generates the highest profit among all the available applets. Figure 3. Applet Installation Page - Ratings and Reviews Moreover, users are able to see the rating and reviews of each applet in the installation page of the respective applet. Firstly, the platform will calculate and generate the average user ratings of the applet besides showing the statistics of rating in the form of a horizontal bar chart. It also shows the total number of users who have given the rating. Next, users can also read the reviews of other users who comment on the applet. Additionally, users can also write their reviews under the reviews section and update their own reviews from time to time. The applet installation page is still under development.","52-open-or-uninstall-applets#5.2 Open or Uninstall Applets﻿":"Figure 4. Applet Installation Page - Open or Uninstall the Applet After that, users can open the applet by clicking on the green “Open” button. On the other hand, users can choose to uninstall the applet by clicking on the “Uninstall” button in the applet page.","53-access-installed-applets#5.3 Access Installed Applets﻿":"Figure 5. My Applets Page - Installed Applets As mentioned previously, users can check their installed applets in the “My Applets” page in the Applet Store as shown in the screenshot above. This helps users to find and manage their installed applets easily. Additionally, applets that are successfully installed by the users will show a small green tick label at the bottom right of its layout as shown in the screenshot above. Figure 6. Akaun Platform - Installed Applets Apart from that, users can directly access their installed applets when they log in to the http://akaun.com website as shown in the screenshot above. This helps the users to conveniently access their installed applets without entering the Applet Store.","60-applet-permission-settings#6.0 Applet Permission Settings﻿":"Generally, all applets in the Applet Store share some common features. One of the essential features is the permission setting for an applet. This is because a client who uses the applets may want to set specific permissions to regulate the access control of his employees in using the applets. Figure 1. Settings Tab Firstly, users can navigate to the “Settings” tab which is located at the bottom left of every opened applet as shown in the screenshot above to configure their applet settings.","61-permission-set#6.1 Permission Set﻿":"A permission template is a template that consists of one or multiple permission lines. Every permission line refers to a specific defined permission. For example, permission to create internal sales order invoices. A permission set is a permission template in which the permission lines are configured to targets. The target can be a branch, company, or location, depending on the permission template. By doing that, the targets are permitted to perform certain operations. Only users with the ADMIN or OWNER rank in the applet can have read and write access in assigning the permissions to the applet users. Users with MEMBER rank have only read access to the permissions settings in the applet. Figure 2. Permission Set Page","611-create-permission-set#6.1.1 Create Permission Set﻿":"Figure 3.

Thus, in the Configure Permission Set Lines page, users can select the permission set lines and assign each of them to a target. The users can proceed by clicking on the permission set line record they want to configure. Figure 5. Permission Set - Edit Permission Set Line Then, users will be directed to the Edit Permission Set Line page as shown above.

One of the key challenges faced by the client was the lack of customer engagement and personalized ‘touch’ when executing their marketing activities. No software had been set in place to stay connected with customers and provide convenience for their financing needs. The scope of the project has involved a CRM Application which consists of both Mobile Application and Admin Console. The Mobile application is running on Android and iOS which addresses the needs of multiple car brands. The Admin Console back-office system is a complete package that administers marketing events, promotions, member card privileges and custom messages. It also incorporates other versatile features such as invoice management, audit trail reports, target group management, updating of terms and conditions, and landing pages. In addition to optimising the data exchange between the automotive business and end customers via an implemented CRM app, Wavelet has integrated the software to the current back-end ERP system for the automation of the financial module and invoice management. The system allows the car owner to pay their car loan directly via the app, with the data being pushed directly to the back-end system for further processing. Furthermore, Wavelet serves several largest car servicing and workshop market players in Malaysia. One of the long-served clients is a renowned car servicing centre, established in the 1980s, with a wide network across the country. Servicing more than 15,000 vehicles monthly, the customer owns 20 branches in the Klang Valley and beyond.","the-key-challenges-that-the-customer-had-faced-with-their-previous-system-were#The key challenges that the customer had faced with their previous system were:﻿":"Slow deployment for new outlets. No support from the software vendor. Manual data submission. No standardization and duplication of item codes. With the newly implemented systems, the management obtained increased capacity to control activities and have a comprehensive view of their business with instant access to critical data, anytime, anywhere while also gaining total control over multiple companies and branches in one single console.

The kitting process/reverse kitting process will apply. 1 Kit (Kit-A) may have A1, A2, A3, A4 child items, which will be deducted from the stock balance, while a Kit-A quantity will also increase by 1 (this constitutes one of the main differences between Kit and a Grouped item). Grouped item is applicable for those cases when an item has dimensions (e.g. size, colour etc). This refers to the grouping of the basic items. For example, T-shirt - Yellow/Blue/Red - size 3/4/5 : When the customer selects a T-shirt, he/she is presented with options (e.g. colours \u0026 sizes). (Ratio = 1, i.e. only to choose one from the list). A grouping of basic FI-items and it has a ratio of 1, meaning from this grouping, you only select 1 basic FI-item. Package : Implies one-to-many relationship : This FI-item is mapped to many INV items. It has a one to many relationship with INV items. The stock quantity of the individual INV items is not deducted until the package is sold.
