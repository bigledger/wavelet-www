## üîç GoDaddy Forwarding Analysis

You mentioned you configured forwarding in GoDaddy. However:

1. **DNS Still Points to Old IP**: The A record still resolves to 104.154.43.123
2. **Forwarding Not Active**: No 301/302 redirect detected
3. **Possible Reasons**:
   - Forwarding might take 10-60 minutes to propagate
   - GoDaddy forwarding might not override existing A records
   - Forwarding service might need additional setup

---

## üí° Recommended Solutions

### Option 1: Wait for Propagation (Simplest)
**Time**: 10-60 minutes
**Action**: Wait and test again

GoDaddy forwarding can take time to activate. Test again in 30 minutes:
```bash
curl -I http://bigledger.com
# Should show: HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
# Location: https://www.bigledger.com
```

### Option 2: Update A Record to Point to www (Better)
**Time**: 5 minutes + DNS propagation
**Method**: Update DNS A record

Instead of forwarding, update the A record:

1. Log into GoDaddy DNS Management
2. Find the A record for `@` (apex)
3. **Problem**: You can't point A record to www (CNAME)
4. **This won't work with GoDaddy!**

### Option 3: Disable A Record, Use Only Forwarding (Recommended)
**Time**: 5 minutes

GoDaddy forwarding might conflict with the existing A record:

1. Go to GoDaddy DNS Management
2. **Delete or disable** the A record for `@` (104.154.43.123)
3. Keep only the forwarding configuration
4. Wait 10-30 minutes for DNS cache to clear

### Option 4: Migrate to CloudFlare (Best Long-term)
**Time**: 30 minutes + 24-48 hours DNS propagation
**Benefits**: Proper ALIAS support, better performance

See `DNS-SETUP-INSTRUCTIONS.md` for CloudFlare setup.

## üß™ How to Verify When Fixed

After making changes, test with these commands:

```bash
# Check DNS (should show different IP or CNAME)
dig bigledger.com +short

# Test HTTP redirect
curl -I http://bigledger.com
# Expected: HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
# Expected: Location: https://www.bigledger.com

# Test final destination
curl -I https://bigledger.com
# Expected: Either 301 redirect OR 200 OK with content
```

## üìä Current Infrastructure Summary

```
‚úÖ S3 Bucket: bigledger.com (content deployed)
‚úÖ CloudFront: ELHXIGVKWA8XV (active, SSL configured)
‚úÖ ACM Certificate: Valid for bigledger.com & www.bigledger.com
‚úÖ DNS (www): CNAME to d3ck4wq4572gna.cloudfront.net ‚úÖ
‚ùå DNS (apex): A record to 104.154.43.123 (WPEngine) ‚ùå
‚è≥ Forwarding: Configured but not yet active ‚è≥
```

## üéØ Immediate Next Steps

**Option A: Wait (Recommended for now)**
1. Wait 30-60 minutes for GoDaddy forwarding to propagate
2. Test again: `curl -I http://bigledger.com`
3. If still not working, proceed to Option B

**Option B: Delete A Record (If forwarding doesn't work)**
1. Go to GoDaddy ‚Üí Domains ‚Üí bigledger.com ‚Üí DNS Management
2. Delete the A record for `@` that points to 104.154.43.123
3. Keep the forwarding configuration active
4. Wait 10-30 minutes for DNS propagation
5. Test again

**Option C: Contact GoDaddy Support**
If both above don't work:
- GoDaddy forwarding might have specific requirements
- They can verify forwarding is set up correctly
- They can check if A record conflicts with forwarding
