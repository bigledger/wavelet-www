## 5. AI Crawler & LLM Optimization

### Overview

With the rise of AI search (Google AI Overviews, ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity), optimizing for LLM crawlers is now essential. 18% of Google searches now trigger AI Overviews.

### Key Principles for LLM Optimization

#### 1. Server-Side Rendering (Already Implemented)
- Hugo generates static HTML - excellent for AI crawlers
- No JavaScript rendering required
- All content visible to AI bots

#### 2. Clean Semantic HTML Structure
```html
<!-- Good for LLMs -->
<article>
  <h1>Main Topic</h1>
  <section>
    <h2>Subtopic</h2>
    <p>Clear, well-structured content</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Structured list items</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
</article>

<!-- Avoid -->
<div class="content">
  <div class="title">Main Topic</div>
  <div class="section">...</div>
</div>
```

#### 3. Implement llms.txt Standard (NEW)

Create `/static/llms.txt` file:
