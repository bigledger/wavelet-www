## Key Findings

### Critical Opportunity: E-Invoice Malaysia
**HIGHEST PRIORITY - Immediate Action Required**

The Malaysian government's e-invoice mandate is creating massive search demand:
- **Phase 3 deadline: July 1, 2025** (RM5-25M annual turnover businesses)
- **Phase 4: January 2026** (RM1-5M businesses)
- **Phase 5: July 2026** (All businesses)

**Keywords:**
- "e-invoice malaysia" - HIGH volume, HIGH intent
- "lhdn e-invoice system" - Trending up
- "peppol malaysia" - Compliance-related
- "mdec peppol accredited" - Trust signal

**Competitive Advantage:**
Wavelet is MDEC PEPPOL certified - a major differentiator. Most SMEs don't know what PEPPOL is or why it matters. Educational content + trust signals = conversion opportunity.

**Recommendation:**
Create comprehensive E-Invoice landing page as **HIGHEST PRIORITY** (Week 1).

## Why This Strategy Will Work

### 1. Market Timing
E-invoice deadline (July 2025) creates immediate, high-intent search demand. Businesses MUST comply or face penalties.

### 2. Competitive Advantage
MDEC PEPPOL certification is a unique differentiator. Most SMEs searching for solutions don't understand PEPPOL importance. Educational content + trust signals = conversions.

### 3. AI-First Approach
While competitors focus only on traditional SEO, we're optimizing for both:
- Traditional search (Google blue links)
- AI search (Google AI Overviews, ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity)
- Future-proofing as AI search adoption increases

### 4. Comprehensive Content
2,500-3,000 word comprehensive guides provide:
- Better user experience
- Higher engagement (lower bounce rates)
- More internal linking opportunities
- Better rankings (depth signals authority)
- AI-friendly (more context for extraction)

### 5. Technical Foundation
Hugo + Hextra theme provides excellent technical foundation:
- Fast page load (static site generation)
- Mobile responsive
- Clean HTML structure
- Easy schema markup implementation
