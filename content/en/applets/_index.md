BigLedger's modular architecture is built on applets - reusable components that provide specific business functionality. Each applet can be used by multiple modules, ensuring consistency across your entire system.

## Understanding Applets

{{< callout type="info" >}}
**Important**: Applets have a many-to-many relationship with modules. For example, the Tax Configuration Applet is used by Financial Accounting, Sales, Purchasing, and E-Commerce modules. This design eliminates duplication and ensures consistent behavior across the system.
