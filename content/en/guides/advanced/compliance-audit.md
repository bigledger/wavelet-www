## Audit Trail Requirements

A robust audit trail is your first line of defense against fraud, errors, and regulatory violations. After decades of working with auditors, I've learned what they really look for.

## IFRS/MFRS Compliance Features

Financial reporting compliance requires deep understanding of accounting standards and their practical implementation.

### Revenue Recognition (MFRS 15)

**5-Step Revenue Model Implementation**
```yaml
Step 1: Contract Identification
Contract Criteria Assessment:
  - Parties have approved the contract
  - Rights of parties are identifiable
  - Payment terms are identifiable
  - Contract has commercial substance
  - Collection is probable

Contract Modifications:
  - Separate contract treatment
  - Modification of existing contract
  - Combination approach
  - Prospective vs. retrospective

Step 2: Performance Obligations
Identification Criteria:
  - Promised goods/services to customer
  - Distinct within contract context
  - Customer can benefit independently
  - Separately identifiable from other promises

Bundling Assessment:
  - Series of distinct goods/services
  - Same pattern of transfer
  - Single performance obligation
  - Revenue recognition over time
```

**Practical Revenue Recognition Examples**
```yaml
Software Licensing + Support:
Contract Details:
  - Software license: MYR 100,000
  - Annual support: MYR 20,000
  - Implementation: MYR 30,000
  - Total contract: MYR 150,000

Performance Obligations:

  - Total: MYR 170,000

Allocation:
  Software: MYR 150,000 × (110,000/170,000) = MYR 97,059
  Implementation: MYR 150,000 × (35,000/170,000) = MYR 30,882
  Support: MYR 150,000 × (25,000/170,000) = MYR 22,059

Revenue Recognition:
  - Software: At go-live date

```

### Lease Accounting (MFRS 16)

**Lessee Accounting Implementation**
```yaml

Initial Measurement:
Lease liability: PV of 60 payments @ 6% = MYR 516,074
Right-of-use asset: MYR 516,074 + MYR 20,000 = MYR 536,074

Subsequent Measurement:
Monthly entries:
Dr. Depreciation expense (MYR 536,074/60)    MYR 8,935
