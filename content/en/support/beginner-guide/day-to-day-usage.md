---

## Daily Operations

**Q: How do I record a sale?**

**A:** Recording a sale is like writing a receipt, but BigLedger makes it much more powerful:

**For Simple Sales** (immediate payment):
1. **Create new invoice**
2. **Select customer** (or add new one quickly)
3. **Add products/services** sold
4. **System calculates total** including taxes
5. **Mark as "Paid"** and choose payment method
6. **Done!** Everything else happens automatically

**For Credit Sales** (customer pays later):
1. **Create invoice** (same steps as above)
2. **Leave as "Unpaid"**
3. **Send invoice** to customer (email directly from BigLedger)
4. **When payment comes**: Record payment against invoice

**What BigLedger Does Automatically**:
- Updates inventory (reduces stock)
- Records accounting entries
- Calculates taxes
- Updates customer account
- Tracks sales performance

**Real-World Examples**:

*Example 1 - Coffee Shop*:
- Customer buys coffee and muffin for $8.50 cash
- Select "Walk-in Customer"
- Add: Coffee ($5.00) + Muffin ($3.50)
- Total: $8.50
- Payment: Cash
- Takes 30 seconds to record

*Example 2 - Consulting Service*:
- Completed 5 hours of consulting for ABC Company
- Select "ABC Company" customer
- Add: "Business Consulting" 5 hours × $150 = $750
- Leave as unpaid (send invoice)
- Customer pays in 30 days

**Beginner Tips**:
- **Set up common products/services** first to speed up entry
- **Use customer search** - type first few letters to find quickly
- **Double-check amounts** before finalizing
- **Save customer email** to send invoices instantly

3. **Fill in key details**:
   - What you bought
   - How much you paid
   - Which supplier/vendor
   - Category (rent, supplies, etc.)
4. **Attach receipt photo** (optional but recommended)
5. **Save**

**Different Ways to Track Expenses**:

**Method 1: Manual Entry** (Best for beginners)

**Q: How do I know who owes me money?**

**A:** This is crucial for cash flow! BigLedger makes it easy to track and collect:

**Instant Overview**:
- **Dashboard**: Shows total owed at a glance
- **Accounts Receivable**: List of all unpaid invoices
- **Aging Report**: Shows how old each debt is

**Understanding the Aging Report**:
```
Customer         Current   1-30   31-60   61-90   Over 90
ABC Company      $1,200    $500    $0      $0      $0
XYZ Corp         $0        $800    $400    $0      $0
Johnson Family   $0        $0      $200    $300    $100
```

**What Each Column Means**:
- **Current**: Just sent, not due yet
- **1-30 days**: Recently due, normal follow-up
- **31-60 days**: Needs attention, send reminder
- **61-90 days**: Problem account, call customer
- **Over 90 days**: Serious collection issue

**Daily Actions**:
1. **Check dashboard** first thing each morning
2. **Follow up on 30+ day invoices** immediately
3. **Send payment reminders** (BigLedger can automate this)
4. **Call customers** with 60+ day balances

**Collection Best Practices**:
- **Send invoices immediately** when work is done

- **Consider collection agency** for very old debts
