import { BigLedgerClient } from '@bigledger/sdk';

const client = new BigLedgerClient({
  apiKey: process.env.BIGLEDGER_API_KEY,
  companyId: process.env.BIGLEDGER_COMPANY_ID
});

// Create customer and invoice
const customer = await client.customers.create({
  name: 'Acme Corporation',
  email: 'billing@acme.com'
});

const invoice = await client.invoices.create({
  customerId: customer.id,
  items: [{
    description: 'Professional Services',
    quantity: 10,
