## 📋 Core Distribution Workflows

### 1. Multi-Tier Pricing and Customer Management

#### Scenario A: Setting Up Complex Pricing Structure

**Objective**: Configure a multi-tier pricing system for different customer segments

**Customer Story**: MegaDistro serves various customer types from small retailers to large chains, each requiring different pricing structures.

**Step-by-Step Workflow**:

1. **Define Customer Tiers**
   - Navigate to **Sales** → **Customer Management** → **Pricing Tiers**
   - Create tier structure:
     - **Platinum**: Volume >$500k annually, 8% margin, Net 45 terms
     - **Gold**: Volume $200k-500k, 12% margin, Net 30 terms
     - **Silver**: Volume $50k-200k, 16% margin, Net 15 terms
     - **Bronze**: Volume <$50k, 20% margin, Net 10 terms

2. **Configure Volume Breakpoints**
   - Set automatic tier upgrades based on trailing 12-month purchases
   - **Expected Result**: System automatically promotes customers when volume thresholds are met
   - Configure tier benefits:
     - Platinum: Free shipping on orders >$1,000
     - Gold: 2% early payment discount
     - Silver: 1% early payment discount
     - Bronze: Standard terms

3. **Customer-Specific Negotiated Rates**
   - For key account "TechMart Corp" (Platinum tier):
     - Override standard margin on specific product categories
     - Gaming products: 6% margin (vs 8% standard)
     - Smartphones: 4% margin (competitive pricing)
     - Accessories: 12% margin (higher margin items)
   - **Expected Result**: Customer sees negotiated pricing in their portal

     - Customer: TechMart Corp (Platinum)
     - Product: iPhone 15 Pro, Qty: 25 units
     - Base cost: $1,000, Standard margin: 8%, Negotiated: 4%

   - Current outstanding: $45,000
   - Total exposure would be: $130,000 (exceeds $75,000 limit)
   - **Expected Result**: Order automatically placed on hold for credit approval
   - Notification sent to credit manager and sales rep

4. **Credit Decision Workflow**
   - Credit manager reviews customer payment history
   - Options presented:
     - **Approve**: One-time exception with documentation
     - **Partial**: Approve $30,000 portion, hold remainder
