- **Integration Architecture** - API design, event streaming, and external integrations
- **Security Architecture** - Authentication, authorization, and data protection

#### Infrastructure Architecture
- **Cloud Architecture** - Multi-region deployment and cloud infrastructure
- **Scalability Design** - Horizontal scaling, load balancing, and performance optimization
- **Deployment Architecture** - Container orchestration, CI/CD, and environment management
- **Monitoring & Observability** - Logging, metrics, tracing, and alerting

#### Domain-Specific Architecture

- **Reporting Architecture** - Analytics, reporting, and business intelligence

## Key Architectural Principles

### 1. Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
BigLedger is organized around business domains with clear boundaries and responsibilities:

```
Business Domains:
├── Core Platform
│   ├── Identity & Access Management
│   ├── Tenant & Organization Management
│   └── System Configuration
├── Financial Operations
│   ├── Accounting & General Ledger
│   ├── Accounts Receivable
│   └── Accounts Payable
├── Supply Chain
│   ├── Inventory Management
│   ├── Purchasing & Procurement
│   └── Manufacturing
├── Customer Operations
│   ├── Sales & CRM
│   ├── E-Commerce
│   └── Point of Sale
└── Compliance & Analytics
    ├── E-Invoice & Tax Compliance
    ├── Reporting & Analytics
    └── Audit & Compliance
```

### 2. Microservices Architecture
Each business domain is implemented as independent, loosely-coupled microservices:

- **Service Autonomy** - Independent deployment and scaling
- **Technology Diversity** - Best tool for each job
- **Fault Isolation** - Failure containment and resilience
- **Team Independence** - Autonomous development teams

### 3. Event-Driven Architecture
Business operations generate events that drive system behavior:

- **Asynchronous Communication** - Loose coupling between services
- **Event Sourcing** - Complete audit trail and state reconstruction
- **Real-Time Updates** - Immediate system-wide notifications
- **Integration Flexibility** - Easy third-party system integration

### 4. Multi-Tenant SaaS Design
Secure tenant isolation with efficient resource sharing:

- **Schema-per-Tenant** - Maximum security and customization
- **Shared Infrastructure** - Cost-effective resource utilization
- **Tenant Context** - Automatic data isolation and routing
- **Feature Flexibility** - Per-tenant feature enablement
